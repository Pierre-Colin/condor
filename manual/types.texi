Including @code{condor.h} makes visible the type @code{size_t} as defined in
the standard @code{<stddef.h>} header.

In addition, Condor defines two C types.

@deftp {Data Type} cdor_adv
This unsigned integer type is intended to represent numbers of votes.

To be more precise, it's defined as
@itemize
@item
@code{unsigned long long} in C++11 and above, C99 and above or when the GNU C
extentions are enabled;

@item
@code{unsigned long} otherwise.
@end itemize

It is unsafe to compile Condor in a setting where it is defined as one type and
use it in a setting where it is defined as the other.
@end deftp

@deftp {Data Type} {struct cdor_strategy} type val
This structure is returned by @code{cdor_optimal_strategy}.  It contains two
data members:
@itemize
@item
an enumerated member @code{type} to compare against the values
@code{CDOR_ERROR}, @code{CDOR_PURE} and @code{CDOR_MIXED};

@item
a union member @code{val} itself having members @code{size_t pure} and
@code{double *mixed}.
@end itemize
